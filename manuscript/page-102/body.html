I know the influence you have with Hippolita: her conscience is in your hands.  She is, I allow, a faultless woman: her soul is set on heaven, and scorns the little grandeur of this world: you can withdraw her from it entirely.  Persuade her to consent to the dissolution of our marriage, and to retire into a monastery—she shall endow one if she will; and she shall have the means of being as liberal to your order as she or you can wish.  Thus you will divert the calamities that are hanging over our heads, and have the merit of saying the principality of Otranto from destruction.  You are a prudent man, and though the warmth of my temper betrayed me into some unbecoming expressions, I honour your virtue, and wish to be indebted to you for the repose of my life and the preservation of my family.”</p></div> </div>
