In short, Lady, you have missed a husband undeserving of your charms: they shall now be better disposed of.  Instead of a sickly boy, you shall have a husband in the prime of his age, who will know how to value your beauties, and who may expect a numerous offspring.”</p><p>“Alas, my Lord!” said Isabella, “my mind is too sadly engrossed by the recent catastrophe in your family to think of another marriage.

In short, Isabella, since I cannot give you my son, I offer you myself.”</p></div> </div>
