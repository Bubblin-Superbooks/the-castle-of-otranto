We looked under every bench and stool; and still we found nobody.”</p><p>“Were all the pictures in their places?” said Manfred.</p><p>“Yes, my Lord,” answered Jaquez; “but we did not think of looking behind them.”</p><p>“Well, well!” said Manfred; “proceed.”</p><p>“When we came to the door of the great chamber,” continued Jaquez, “we found it shut.”</p></div> </div>
