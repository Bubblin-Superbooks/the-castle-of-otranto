Manfred, in the agony for the loss of thy brother, knew not what he said; perhaps Isabella misunderstood him; his heart is good—and, my child, thou knowest not all!  There is a destiny hangs over us; the hand of Providence is stretched out; oh! could I but save thee from the wreck!

I will withdraw into the neighbouring monastery, and waste the remainder of life in prayers and tears for my child and—the Prince!”</p><p>“Thou art as much too good for this world,” said Isabella, “as Manfred is execrable; but think not, lady, that thy weakness shall determine for me.  I swear, hear me all ye angels—”</p><p>“Stop, I adjure thee,” cried Hippolita: “remember thou dost not depend on thyself; thou hast a father.”</p></div> </div>
